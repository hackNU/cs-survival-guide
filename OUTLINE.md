CS Survival Guide Outline
=========================

The survival guide will be hosted online (NOT printed),
so as to save paper/money, as well as be a source of up-to-date information.
Also, the ability to ctrl-f :)
Consult [how to gamit](http://web.mit.edu/htgamit/www/) for possible topics.


# Content

The current topics for the guide are as follows:
- Courses to watch out for
- Possible career paths for cs students


# Previewing a Page

- Please use the previewer to see how your content will look on a page.
- For any style requests (example: maybe the header should be smaller) open a github issue.
